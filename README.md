## What is Paperclip?

# Open-source orchestration for zero-human companies

**If OpenClaw is an _employee_, Paperclip is the _company_**

Paperclip is a Node.js server and React UI that orchestrates a team of AI agents to run a business. Bring your own agents, assign goals, and track your agents' work and costs from one dashboard.

It looks like a task manager — but under the hood it has org charts, budgets, governance, goal alignment, and agent coordination.

**Manage business goals, not pull requests.**

|        | Step            | Example                                                            |
| ------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **01** | Define the goal | _"Build the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR."_                    |
| **02** | Hire the team   | CEO, CTO, engineers, designers, marketers — any bot, any provider. |
| **03** | Approve and run | Review strategy. Set budgets. Hit go. Monitor from the dashboard.  |

<br/>

> **COMING SOON: Clipmart** — Download and run entire companies with one click. Browse pre-built company templates — full org structures, agent configs, and skills — and import them into your Paperclip instance in seconds.

## Problems Paperclip solves

| Without Paperclip                                                                                                                     | With Paperclip                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ You have 20 Claude Code tabs open and can't track which one does what. On reboot you lose everything.                              | ✅ Tasks are ticket-based, conversations are threaded, sessions persist across reboots.                                                |
| ❌ You manually gather context from several places to remind your bot what you're actually doing.                                     | ✅ Context flows from the task up through the project and company goals — your agent always knows what to do and why.                  |
| ❌ Folders of agent configs are disorganized and you're re-inventing task management, communication, and coordination between agents. | ✅ Paperclip gives you org charts, ticketing, delegation, and governance out of the box — so you run a company, not a pile of scripts. |
| ❌ Runaway loops waste hundreds of dollars of tokens and max your quota before you even know what happened.                           | ✅ Cost tracking surfaces token budgets and throttles agents when they're out. Management prioritizes with budgets.                    |
| ❌ You have recurring jobs (customer support, social, reports) and have to remember to manually kick them off.                        | ✅ Heartbeats handle regular work on a schedule. Management supervises.                                                                |
| ❌ You have an idea, you have to find your repo, fire up Claude Code, keep a tab open, and babysit it.                                | ✅ Add a task in Paperclip. Your coding agent works on it until it's done. Management reviews their work.                              |

<br/>

## Why Paperclip is special

Paperclip handles the hard orchestration details correctly.

|                                   |                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Atomic execution.**             | Task checkout and budget enforcement are atomic, so no double-work and no runaway spend.                      |
| **Persistent agent state.**       | Agents resume the same task context across heartbeats instead of restarting from scratch.                     |
| **Runtime skill injection.**      | Agents can learn Paperclip workflows and project context at runtime, without retraining.                      |
| **Governance with rollback.**     | Approval gates are enforced, config changes are revisioned, and bad changes can be rolled back safely.        |
| **Goal-aware execution.**         | Tasks carry full goal ancestry so agents consistently see the "why," not just a title.                        |
| **Portable company templates.**   | Export/import orgs, agents, and skills with secret scrubbing and collision handling.                          |
| **True multi-company isolation.** | Every entity is company-scoped, so one deployment can run many companies with separate data and audit trails. |

<br/>

## What Paperclip is not

|                              |                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Not a chatbot.**           | Agents have jobs, not chat windows.                                                                                  |
| **Not an agent framework.**  | We don't tell you how to build agents. We tell you how to run a company made of them.                                |
| **Not a workflow builder.**  | No drag-and-drop pipelines. Paperclip models companies — with org charts, goals, budgets, and governance.            |
| **Not a prompt manager.**    | Agents bring their own prompts, models, and runtimes. Paperclip manages the organization they work in.               |
| **Not a single-agent tool.** | This is for teams. If you have one agent, you probably don't need Paperclip. If you have twenty — you definitely do. |
| **Not a code review tool.**  | Paperclip orchestrates work, not pull requests. Bring your own review process.                                       |

## Deploy to Railway

The fastest way to get Paperclip running in the cloud — one click, zero config:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/new/template?template=https://github.com/uai-sara-bot/paperclip&envs=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&optionalEnvs=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=&referralCode=)

### What happens automatically

Everything is configured on first boot — no manual setup needed:

- **Config generation** — creates `config.json` with correct paths and auth settings
- **Auth secret** — generates and persists `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` on the volume
- **Public URL detection** — auto-detects your Railway domain via `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
- **Database** — embedded PostgreSQL, stored on the volume, persists across redeploys
- **CEO invite** — auto-generated on first deploy (check deploy logs for the invite URL)
- **Claude Code CLI** — pre-installed with native binary on the volume
- **Volume permissions** — fixed automatically on every startup

### After deploying

1. **Check deploy logs** for the CEO invite URL — click it to create your admin account
2. **Add a volume** at `/paperclip` if the template didn't create one (Settings → Volumes → New Volume)
3. **Set up Claude Code** — choose one of these options:

#### Option A: API Key (simplest)

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Railway Variables with a standard API key (starts with `sk-ant-api03-...`) from [console.anthropic.com/settings/keys](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys). The agent will use it automatically — no login needed.

> **Note:** OAuth tokens (`sk-ant-oat01-...`) don't work with Claude Code CLI. You need a standard API key.

#### Option B: Claude Max Subscription (no API costs)

If you have a Claude Pro/Max subscription, you can use it instead of paying per-API-call. This requires a one-time SSH login after each fresh deployment:

**Step 1:** Open an SSH shell in your Railway container (Railway Dashboard → your Paperclip service → Settings → SSH, or use the CLI):

```bash
railway shell
```

**Step 2:** Run the login helper script:

```bash
/claude-login.sh
```

**Step 3:** Follow the prompts — select "Claude account with subscription", then authenticate in the browser.

That's it! The helper script saves credentials to the persistent volume and fixes file permissions automatically. Agents will use your subscription with no further setup.

> **⚠️ Always use `/claude-login.sh`** instead of running `claude login` directly. The helper script ensures:
> - Credentials are saved to the persistent volume at `/paperclip/.claude/`
> - File permissions are set correctly so the server process can read them
> - Everything works immediately — no manual `chown` needed

> **Note:** You only need to do this once per fresh deployment. Credentials persist on the volume across redeploys and container restarts.

### Environment variables

These variables should be set in your **Railway service's Variables tab** (not just in the Dockerfile):

#### Required for Claude Code to work

| Variable | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `HOME` | `/paperclip` | **Must be set as a Railway variable.** Ensures all processes (including SSH sessions) use the persistent volume as the home directory. Without this, credentials and configs won't be found. |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | `/paperclip/.claude` | **Must be set as a Railway variable.** Tells Claude Code where to find credentials and config. Without this, Claude will prompt for login even when credentials exist on the volume. |

> **⚠️ These two variables are critical.** The Dockerfile sets them at build time, but Railway SSH sessions and the runtime environment need them set as Railway service variables to work correctly.

#### Server configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Server bind address. |
| `PORT` | `3100` | Server port. |
| `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` | `authenticated` | Set to `authenticated` for public deployments (requires login). |
| `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_EXPOSURE` | `public` | Set to `public` to allow external access. |
| `PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL` | Auto-detected | Your public URL. Auto-detected from `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` if not set. |

#### Optional / Auto-generated

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Standard Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-api03-...`). Only needed if **not** using Claude Max subscription login. |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Session signing secret. Auto-generated and persisted on the volume if not set. |
| `PAPERCLIP_AGENT_JWT_SECRET` | Agent JWT signing secret. Auto-generated if not set. |

All data persists on the `/paperclip` volume — database, configs, auth credentials, backups, and agent state survive across redeploys.

## Quickstart (Local)

Open source. Self-hosted. No Paperclip account required.

```bash
npx paperclipai onboard --yes
```

Or manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip.git
cd paperclip
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts the API server at `http://localhost:3100`. An embedded PostgreSQL database is created automatically — no setup required.

> **Requirements:** Node.js 20+, pnpm 9.15+

<br/>

## FAQ

**What does a typical setup look like?**
Locally, a single Node.js process manages an embedded Postgres and local file storage. For production, point it at your own Postgres and deploy however you like. Configure projects, agents, and goals — the agents take care of the rest.

If you're a solo-entreprenuer you can use Tailscale to access Paperclip on the go. Then later you can deploy to e.g. Vercel when you need it.

**Can I run multiple companies?**
Yes. A single deployment can run an unlimited number of companies with complete data isolation.

**How is Paperclip different from agents like OpenClaw or Claude Code?**
Paperclip _uses_ those agents. It orchestrates them into a company — with org charts, budgets, goals, governance, and accountability.

**Why should I use Paperclip instead of just pointing my OpenClaw to Asana or Trello?**
Agent orchestration has subtleties in how you coordinate who has work checked out, how to maintain sessions, monitoring costs, establishing governance - Paperclip does this for you.

(Bring-your-own-ticket-system is on the Roadmap)

**Do agents run continuously?**
By default, agents run on scheduled heartbeats and event-based triggers (task assignment, @-mentions). You can also hook in continuous agents like OpenClaw. You bring your agent and Paperclip coordinates.
